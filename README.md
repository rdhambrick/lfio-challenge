# LightFeather.io Backend Engineer Coding Challenge  

This application serves requests at the following endpoints:  
> GET /api/supervisors  
> POST /api/submit  

By default, requests are served on port 8080; however, that can be changed by including the argument `--args='--server.port=##'` with the run command below where `##` is the desired port.  
 
To launch the application, run the following command on Windows:  
`gradlew bootRun`  
or on Mac or Linux:  
`./gradlew bootRun`
